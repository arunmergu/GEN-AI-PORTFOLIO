effective  dashboard  \nTo make your dashboard enthralling and appealing to the end user, you \nmay consider  the following best practices:  \n\u2022 Connect to all your data regardless of where it resides. If the \nrequired data is present in external and internal locations, \ncentralizing your data at one location is not preferable since it will \nslow down the process of dash board designing. Hence, you must \nconnect to the data wherever it is present.  \n\u2022 Blend your data from multiple sources. For a comprehensive view \nof your data, you should join data from multiple data sets on a \ncommon field. This allows you perform analysis at a  granular level.  \n\u2022 Include only the relevant measures . Consider the objectives of your \norganization before selecting a measure . The measure  you choose \nmust compel to these objectives and should build a systematic \nmeasurement.  \n\u2022 Choose the right visualization . For an end user, i nterpreting data \npresent in a text table or spreadsheet is difficult as compared to \ndata in presented in a visualization. For complex business queries, \nyou must use a visualization that represents your data in the most \neffective way.  \n\u2022 Utilize mobile solutions. Mobile business intelligence allows you to \naccess data at your convenience , whenever and wherever it is \nneeded .  \n\u2022 Before making your dashboard available for end users, perform a \nseries of testing and get feedback.

This informs a viewer about the relative \ncontribution that line contributes to the whole.  \n3. Considerations while creating Pie Chart  \n\u2022 Limit pie wedges to six: If you have more than six proportions \nto communicate, consider a bar chart. It becomes too har d to \nmeaningfully interpret the pie pieces when the number of \nwedges gets too high.  \n\u2022 Overlay pies on map: Pies can be an interesting way to \nhighlight geographical trends in your data. If you choose to \nuse this technique, use pies with only a couple of wedge s to \nkeep it easy to understand.  \n4.

He may take any one of the face-up cards or he may draw the top card from the\ndeck (this is a blind draw). If he draws a face up card, he immediately turns a replacement card face-up from the deck. He then draws his second\ncard, either from the face up cards or from the top of the deck. (See Train Car Cards for special rules for Locomotive cards).\nClaim a Route \u2013 The player may claim a route on the board by playing a set of Train Car cards that match the color and length of the route and\nthen placing one of his colored trains on each space of this route. He then records his score by moving his Scoring Marker the appropriate number\nof spaces (see Route Scoring Table) along the Scoring Track on the board.\nDraw Destination Tickets \u2013 The player draws 3 Destination Tickets from the top of the deck. He must keep at least one of them, but he may keep\ntwo or all three if he chooses. Any returned cards are placed on the bottom of the deck.\nT rain Car Cards\nThere are 8 types of regular Train Car cards, plus Locomotive cars. The colors of each type of Train Car card match various rou tes\nbetween cities on the board \u2013 Purple, Blue, Orange, White, Green, Yellow, Black, and\nRed. \nLocomotives are Multi-colored and act as a wild card that can be part of any set of\ncards when claiming a route. If a Locomotive card is one of the five face-up cards , the\nplayer who draws it may only draw one card, instead of two. If, after having drawn one\ncard the replacement card is a Locomotive, the player cannot take it. If at any time, three\nof the five face-up cards are Locomotives, all five cards are immediately discarded and\nfive new ones are turned face-up to replace them. \nNote: If a player is lucky enough to get a Locomotive from the top of the deck in a blind\ndraw, it stills counts as a single card and he may still draw a total of two cards that turn.\nA player may have any number of cards in his hand at any time.\nWhen the deck is exhausted, the discards are reshuffled into a new draw pile deck. The\ncards should be shuffled thoroughly, since all the cards have been discarded in sets.\nIn the unlikely event that there are no cards left in the deck and there are no discards\n(because players are hoarding many cards in their hands), a player cannot draw Train\nCar cards. Instead he may only claim a route or draw Destination Ticket cards.\nClaiming Routes\nTo claim a route, a player must play a set of cards equal to the number of spaces in the\nroute. A set of cards must be of the same type. Most routes require a specific type of set.\nFor example a Blue route must be claimed using blue-colored Passenger Car cards. Some\nroutes \u2013 those that are Gray colored \u2013 can be claimed using a set of cards of any one color.\nWhen a route is claimed, the player places one of his plastic trains in each of the spaces\nof the route. All the cards in the set used to claim the route are then discarded.\nA player may claim any open route on the board. He is never required to\nconnect to any of his previously played routes. A player may only claima maximum of one route, hence connect two adjacent cities, never more,on his turn.\nSome cities are connected by Double-Routes . One player cannot claim\nboth routes to the same cities. Important Note: In 2 or 3 player games, only one of the Double-Routes\ncan be used. A player can claim either of the two routes between cities, but\nthe other route is then closed to other players.\u222b \u2211\n\u2211\u222b\n\u03c0\n\u220f \u00aa\nTo claim the route from Montr\u00e9al \nto Toronto, a player could use any\nset of Train Car cards, as a long \nas they are the same type.Example 2\nTo claim the route from Montr\u00e9al\nto New York, a player would need \na set of three Blue Passenger \nCar cards.

To do so, he draws 3 new cards from the top of the Destination Ticket Deck. He mustkeep at least one of the cards, but may also keep two or all three if he chooses. If there are less than 3 Destination Tickets left in the deck, the playeronly draws the cards that are available. Any returned cards are placed on the bottom of the Destination Ticket Deck.\nEach Destination Ticket includes the name of two cities on the map and a Point Value. If a player successfully completes a series of routes that connect\nthe two cities, they will add the amount of points indicated on the Destination Ticket to their point totals at the end of the game. If they do not\nsuccessfully connect the two cities, they deduct the amount of points indicated.\nDestination Tickets are kept secret from other players until the game's final scoring. A player may have any number of Destination Ticket cards duringthe game.\nGame End\nWhen one player\u2019s stock of colored plastic trains gets down to only 0,1 or 2 trains left at the end of his turn, each player, including that player, getsone final turn. The game then ends and players calculate their final scores. \nCalculating Scores\nPlayers should have already accounted for the points earned as they completed different routes. To make sure no mistakes were made, you maywant to re-count the points for each player\u2019s routes.\nPlayers should then reveal all their Destination Tickets and add (or subtract) the value of their Destination Tickets still in hand, based on whether\nthey successfully (or not) connected those cities together.\nThe player who has the Longest Continuous Path of routes receives this special bonus card and adds 10 points to his score. When evaluating and\ncomparing path lengths, only take into account continuous lines of plastic trains of the same color. A continuous path may include loops, and passthrough the same city several times, but a given plastic train may never be used twice in the same continuous path. In the case of a tie for the longestpath, all tied players score the 10 point bonus.\nThe player with the most points wins the game. If two or more players are tied for the most points, the player who has completed the most Destination\nTickets wins. In the unlikely event that they are still tied, the player with the Longest Continuous Path card wins.\n1Route Length Points Scored\n2\n3\n4\n5\n61\n2\n4\n7\n10\n15\nCREDITS\nGame design by Alan R.
